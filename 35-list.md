# 35 by ~35~ 40

This is the living list of the 35 things I want to do by age ~35~ 40. I
[created the list](/blog/post/35-by-35/) at the age of 30 in 2014. I have currently
completed **10 of 35** items.

UPDATE: I turned 36 in August of 2020, so I didn't make it as far as I'd
have liked. That being said, I'm going to keep pushing - maybe I'll make
it by 40!
