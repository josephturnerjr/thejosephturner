title: Things That I Think Are Interesting

# Things that I think are interesting

[Marc Andreessen](http://blog.pmarca.com/), in the
[podcast](https://tim.blog/2016/05/29/marc-andreessen/) he did with Tim
Ferriss, described his process for choosing areas of investment. As a
guidepost, he says to look for (paraphrasing) what nerds are doing on
the weekends - in other words, what smart, inquisitive people are
thinking about and spending their free time on today. 

After I heard the show, I made a list of things I currently find
interesting, some of which I've explored. This is that list, in no
particular order and with questionable organization. I think many of
these concepts have the possibility of being disruptive at large scale
(some, like machine learning, clearly already are). I'd like to keep
this list alive by adding pages for each topic, with links to resources
and things.
