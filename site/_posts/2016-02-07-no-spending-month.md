title: "A Month of Buying (Practically) Nothing"
---

A couple years ago I read a not-particularly-good book I picked up at
the thrift store called [Not Buying It: My Year Without Shopping](http://amzn.to/1NYwfVx).
The merits of the writing and conclusions notwithstanding, the concept
piqued my interest. The family of the book swears off the purchase of
anything not deemed a necessity. For them, this meant they could
purchase nothing but groceries and "essentials", a term meant to capture
the things that they need to survive. Essentials are things like toilet
paper, medicine, and - if I remember correctly - Q-tips. That precludes
everything else, including not only goods but also services. No new
clothes, no new appliances, and the like, but also no going to movies,
no yoga classes, no dining out, no drinks at the bar. Though I remember the book
being pretty banal, the idea seemed like a
good one, and I added an easier version of it to my [35 by 35 list](/35-list.html)
- go one calendar month without buying anything.

At the beginning of every year, I try to convince myself that I am not
an alcoholic by abstaining from the drink for the first two weeks of 
January. Some years I do better than others. This year, I realized I could
make double use of my drying out, and the barrier to my normal social
life that it represents, as motivation for my month of "drying out" from
consumerism. Interestingly, I realized this after I had a couple bottles of
champagne on New Year's Eve, and declared my intention to my also-inebriated companions. 

I woke up the next morning with all the joy that drinking a gallon of
champagne brings, slept in until an hour that my college-aged self would
have found acceptable, and had a quiet day puttering around the house
after finally crawling out of bed. That night, I realized I had completed a full day of both
goals: no booze, and no buying anything. I also realized that I needed
some rules to follow, so I somewhat arbitrarily chose the following:

  1. Groceries are fine, but prepared food is out. This line is very
     arbitrary - is bread a prepared food? - but I felt like the
     judgement line was clear enough. I could buy bread, I could buy deli
     meat, but I couldn't buy a sandwich.
  2. Short-term consumables are fine, and these comprise my "essentials"
     list - medicine, toilet paper, essential toiletries, and nothing
     else.
  3. My existing services would not get cancelled, so the gym was in,
     Netflix stays, and I don't have to open source all of my Github
     projects.
  4. Everything else was out. No food or drink at restaurants and bars,
     no movies, no Amazon, no new services, experiences, or shopping of any kind.

I decided to take individual cases on an individual basis, with the
default being "no". In reality, only a couple of issues came up.
Could I eat chips or other communal food at a restaurant? (no) Could I
buy a new faucet when my kitchen sink sprung a leak? (yes) As an amazing
Christmas gift I had
received a ticket to a Scotch tasting that fell in
the month of my austerity - I decided that was in. I decided gas
for the car was OK too, though I tried to limit my driving to necessary
trips. After the first two weeks, I also decided that grocery-store beer
was fine. Hey, I went two weeks, I can quit any time.

In retrospect, it wasn't really that hard, and I could have extended it
indefinitely. The hardest part was the slightly jarring shift in my
normal social life, at least for the first couple of weeks. It's a
little funny how much of my interaction with friends revolves around
getting drinks or food. Instead, we spent time at each others' houses
(at least, for the stuff I was invited for - I'm sure they were out
having a ball), watching movies, playing games, or going for walks.
After the early confusion, it was really nice to be able to simply spend
time with people I love instead of having to shout over yet another
blown-out bar speaker blaring terrible music.

Another totally unsurprising outcome was that I spent way less money
than I normally do, though that wasn't the goal of the challenge. I'd
guess I spent roughly half of my normal amount, which is already low by
many people's standards. Almost all of the money I did spend went to groceries, as
might be expected.

*As a sidenote: I've used that saving as justification for
buying myself a home theater projector in support of two of my other
goals: watching all the films on both the [Sight & Sound Top 250](http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/24705/the-sight-sound-top-250-films) list and
the [AFI Top 100](http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx) list. I did some research and decided the [Optoma
HD141X](http://amzn.to/1SCv6v3) was the best low-budget projector for
the space I have, and I am unbelievably excited at the prospect of a
107" screen for watching history's greatest films.*

Verdict: not a very hard goal, got to spend some quality time with my
friends, and saved several hundred dollars. I'd say it's probably worth giving it a
shot, particularly if you are a big spender or trying to rein in your
soul-crushing commercialism. And it's way easier than the [beer
mile](/blog/post/beer-mile).
