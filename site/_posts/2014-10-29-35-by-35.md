title: "35 By 35: My plan to be awesome in 5 years or less"
---

A couple months back I turned 30. Like it or not, resist it or embrace
it, at least from a numerological standpoint it is a serious milestone.
About three weeks prior to my birthday, I was talking to my younger
sister and she mentioned that she had finished putting together her *30
by 30* list, a list of 30 things she wanted to accomplish by the time
she reached my venerable age.

Naturally, I wanted to put together a
similar list, but I realized that I would have to accomplish something
awesome every day (and two some days) for the rest of the time before my
birthday. Rather than pigeonhole myself into 30 pieces of low-hanging
fruit, I decided to give myself another 5 years and create a *35 by 35*
list. Strangely, it has taken from then until now to complete the list
(maybe the list itself should have been on the list? meta.).

Without further ado, by 35 I hope to...
