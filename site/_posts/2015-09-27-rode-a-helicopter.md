title: "Riding in a Helicopter: 33 left to go"
---

I don't remember why I decided that riding in a helicopter was such an
interesting thing to do. I mean, I *do* think it's interesting: not many
people have ridden in one, it seems slightly dangerous, and flying is
generally awesome, particularly when you are low to the ground. Whatever
the reason was, though, it made it into my [35 by 35](/35-list.html) list,
and so it was going to happen.

At some point, I read the list to [my
mother](http://creativelandscapesinc.net/), and she mentioned that in
Myrtle Beach they had billboards for a [$20 helicopter
ride](http://www.helicopteradventures.com/) (NB: I am not promoting that
service, they just have the billboards). Why not go as a family? That
particular trip, time and weather didn't permit and the idea got put on
the back burner for later. Also, the service linked above offers $20
rides *per person* for a 2 mile ride. Not very impressive, but
relatively cheap nonetheless.

A month or two later, I get a call from Moms, who informs me that she
was at a benefit for the excellent [Smith Medical
Clinic](http://smithfreeclinic.org/), a free clinic in Pawleys Island,
SC. Part of the benefit was a silent auction, one of the prizes was
a helicopter ride for 3, and she had won the prize! She didn't really
have any details about it aside from someone to call to schedule the
ride, but it sounded great and we planned on going
while my girlfriend and I were in town for our annual trip down for the
Fourth of July. We called and scheduled it, weather permitting, for the Monday
following the 4th (and what ended up as the day after my [beer
mile](/blog/post/beer-mile/)).

The morning of, the weather looked great so Mom, Cassie, and I headed into Georgetown to
the address provided. We didn't know exactly what to expect, but were
thinking it would be something geared toward leisure - we were wrong.
The address turned out to be headquarters of [Rotor
Blade](http://www.rotor-blade.com/), a company that specializes in,
among other things, trimming the trees along power lines using a
30-foot-long saw hanging from a helicopter. At the location in
Georgetown, they also manufacture the blades. Seriously, go check out
the videos on their site, it's crazy stuff! We spoke with the person at
the desk in the office and she told us that our pilot, Dee Haddock,
wasn't around yet. It turns out that Dee is one of the founders of Rotor
Blade, though he is also a recreational pilot, and he and his
wife donated the flight to the silent auction. 

After a few minutes, Dee showed up. He introduced himself and asked
where we'd like to go. At this point, I was still thinking it'd be a
short flight akin to the one described above, and I suggested we fly out
over [Winyah Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winyah_Bay). Dee
chuckled and said that we were practically already over Winyah Bay, and
that he'd just fly us around some. We crossed the street to the
Georgetown airport, and Dee met us there with the helicopter, a [Robinson
R44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_R44).

We loaded up in the helicopter and took off. The ride was much smoother
than I had imagined, both during takeoff and overall. We flew up over
the airfield and then into Winyah Bay, an extensive estuary where
several rivers meet the Atlantic. Dee pointed out old rice paddies, now
used mainly for hunting or overgrown entirely.

We followed the bay out to the ocean then cut south, following the
coastline. We saw a nature preserve that is an important sea turtle
nesting area. Dee told us about how wild hogs were introduced to the
island decades ago for hunting and now pose a threat to the turtles. He
and his brother flew a helicopter there and killed several of the
invasive hogs. It's unclear to me whether they were shooting *from* the
helicopter or not, but pretty cool.

After a short while, we cut back west over the Muddy Bay area and the
estuaries. We flew all the way down to
[McClellanville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClellanville%2C_South_Carolina), marked by the
lighthouse and cut up into the mouth of the inlet there.

From McClellanville, we turned around and headed back across the
estuaries, up to Winyah bay and then north along the ocean, through
Debordieu and up into my hometown, Pawleys Island. We flew over my
parents house, over Dee's house, over my childhood house, and over the
river before heading back to the airstrip

All told, we were airborne for well over an hour and flew close to 100
miles. It was an amazing experience, and if you get the opportunity to
do something similar, jump at it. Thanks to my mother and to Dee for
giving me the opportunity, and thanks to Cassie for enduring an hour of
motion sickness to experience it with me. This ride marked my second on
my list of 35 things, only 33 to go!
