title:  "Climb Hard Boulders with Root Cause Analysis"

I'm very happy to announce that today, Feb. 4, 2017, I crossed another
item off my [35 by 35 list](/35-list.html) (and [yearly
goals](/blog/post/2016-roundup/)) by sending my first outdoor
V8-grade boulder problem, *Right Exit to Fontainezoo*, alternatively
called [W Goes to
Fontainzoo](https://www.mountainproject.com/v/w-goes-to-fontainzoo/110262654).
It represents over a year of effort and attempts, a very [Dave
MacLeod](http://www.hotaches.com/climbing-films/e11/) approach to
climbing. Since I first attempted it, I've worked on my climbing roughly
3 days a week on average, including a period with a torn pulley.

Ultimately, I succeeded on this problem ("solved" it, if you will) with
a reductionist approach quite similar to the root cause analysis of
software failures I've done: in the event of a failure, ask why until
you arrive an issue you can address directly. Start at the beginning of the climb, try your hardest,
fall off. Why did you fail? Because my foot slipped. Why? Because my center of gravity was too far to the right. Why?
Because I was letting my core sag. Pick yourself up, try again,
conscious of keeping your core tight.

I performed that process for
almost every move of the climb, which was two grades harder than my
previous hardest ascent when I started. By reducing the climb to 
a series of fundamental, actionable improvements, I was able to make progress,
despite initially feeling as though the end result was out of reach. Even today, a
year later and much stronger, I subtly adjusted my footwork and my angle
of attack on holds. And today, all the pieces came together, and it was
beautiful.

I'm struck by the similarity to building software and processes. Deliver
a release to customers, find out it's failed for some case. Why?
Because... Why? Because...
Why? Because... Implement the changes at both the software level (so it
works next release) and at the process or team level (so that the
problem doesn't happen again. No wonder so many climbers work in
software.
