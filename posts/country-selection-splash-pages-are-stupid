##  Country Selection Splash Pages Are Stupid

I love the Microplane kitchen tools (and would probably love the woodworking tools too if ever I had used them). What I don&#8217;t love is the unnecessary step of choosing my country upon arriving at [their website](http://www.microplane.com/). In a world where tools like [visitor.js](http://www.visitorjs.com/) exist, much less the vast array of server-side techniques for doing just this, why am I ever forced to click &#8216;Microplane USA&#8217; again?

And it&#8217;s not just kitchen tools either. I commonly see technology providers doing this same thing. In my opinion, it&#8217;s always better to make a best guess then let the user correct if they need to. This is what high-traffic projects like [Firefox ](http://www.firefox.com)do to get people to the correct download. If their assumptions about your language or operating system are incorrect, you&#8217;re just a click away from the correct page, but most people never have to click anything to get to their final destination.
